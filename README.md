# sEMG_CNN_LSTM
The goal of this project was to develop an deep learning model to perform vocal fatigue detection using sEMG collected from subjects' anterior neck.
Two different conventional deep-learning approachs were implemented using Tensorflow library - CNN and LSTM.

Leave-one-subject-out cross-validation was used for evaluation.
